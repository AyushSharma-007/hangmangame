1. Imports and Variables:

Import the random module to pick a random word for guessing.
Define variables to store the secret word, guessed letters, wrong guesses, and number of tries allowed (typically 6-10).
2. Choosing a Word:

Use random.choice() to select a word from a list of words.
Alternatively, you can read words from a text file.
3. Setting Up the Game Board:

Create a display to show the unguessed letters (usually represented by underscores) and the wrongly guessed letters.
You can use lists to keep track of both.
